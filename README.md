# Genetic Algorithm-based Administration Platform (IT PAT Competition 1st Place - 2019)

This is an administration and timetabling program written in Java, JavaFX, and SQLite to automate classes, attendance and generate timetables for high schools (deployed in the top ranked high school in the country).

The project was approximately 40 000 lines long and used a Genetic Algorithm which I designed and implemented based on a number of research papers, including by S. Forrest from the University of New Mexico (Forrest, Stephanie. "Genetic algorithms." ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 28.1 (1996): 77-80.)

This project (and accompanying thesis) won 1st Place in the 2019 National Programming Competition.
